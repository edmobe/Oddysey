Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

You
What do you, own the world
How do you own disorder, disorder
Now
Somewhere between the sacred silence
Sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere
Between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

                <About>"Toxicity" is a single by System of a Down, released in 2002. It was originally released on the Toxicity album (2001).

The writing credit for the song is Malakian/Odadjian/Tankian.

Although it never achieved the mainstream success of "Chop Suey!" and "B.Y.O.B.", Toxicity remains one of System of a Down's most popular songs among fans. The song was ranked #14 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs [1].

The song is in C minor key and it is played on dropped C tuned guitar.[citation needed]

"Toxicity" is a downloadable song for the music video game series Rock Band, and is a featured track in Guitar Hero: Metallica.

It made #53 on the Y2KROQ Top 200 Songs of the Century.

The video was directed by Shavo Odadjian. The beginning of the video shows the streets of Los Angeles, California, then cuts to the band. Daron Malakian can be seen wearing a Los Angeles Kings jersey with his last name on the back most of the time in the video. During the verses, a projector shows homeless people lined against the streets. The end of the video is a reference to a Pantera music video. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/System+of+a+Down/_/Toxicity"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.
